# My First React Project 🚀

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project
This is my first React-based project. It demonstrates the setup of a React application and basic usage of npm commands.  
I will be expanding this project by adding components, pages, and features as I continue learning.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
Optimizes the build for the best performance.  

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  

## Future Plans
- Add a home page for my **Barista Shop** project ☕  
- Create a menu page with animations  
- Add backend connectivity with a database
